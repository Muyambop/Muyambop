<h2>👨‍💻 Network Design Projects:</h2>


# 🏦 Bank Network Design Portfolio

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **hierarchical network design** for a banking environment, built with **redundancy, scalability, and security** in mind.  
The design follows the **three-layer model**:
- **Core Layer**: High-speed backbone for interconnectivity.
- **Distribution Layer**: Policy enforcement, routing, and redundancy.
- **Access Layer**: End-user devices, printers, phones, and wireless access.

The goal is to ensure **reliable, secure, and optimized communication** across multiple departments and floors within the bank.
