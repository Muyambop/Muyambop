# 🛠️ Network Tools Usage & Documentation
Here is the detailed explanations of key tools I used for daily network operations, monitoring, troubleshooting, and documentation. Each section includes **how I used the tool**, a **practical example**, and a **summary**.

---

## 1. 📌 MobaXterm

**How I used it:**  
I used MobaXterm as my main SSH and Telnet client to log into network devices for configuration and troubleshooting. On a daily basis, I relied on it for routine health checks—verifying device uptime, CPU and memory usage, checking routing tables, and ensuring configurations were properly applied.

**Practical Example:**  
I would connect to routers and switches, run diagnostic commands, and generate reports showing the health of critical infrastructure. This helped me ensure that no device was overloaded or misconfigured.

**Summary:**  
✅ MobaXterm helped me manage device configurations and perform daily system health checks efficiently.

---

## 2. 📌 Huawei NCE (Network Cloud Engine)

**How I used it:**  
I used NCE as a centralized platform to monitor Huawei nodes. This tool allowed me to track performance metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage utilization across multiple devices.

**Practical Example:**  
Each day, I generated NE (Network Element) resource utilization reports to keep track of which nodes were nearing capacity or showing abnormal behavior. This proactive monitoring helped in capacity planning and avoided potential outages.

**Summary:**  
✅ NCE gave me a clear overview of Huawei node health and supported daily utilization reporting.

---

## 3. 📌 SolarWinds

**How I used it:**  
SolarWinds was my go-to for monitoring both nodes and links in the network. It provided visibility into traffic flow, link uptime, and latency issues.

**Practical Example:**  
I created daily reports focusing on primary links, ensuring critical paths were stable and had no packet loss or latency spikes. If a primary link showed degradation, I could escalate before customers were affected.

**Summary:**  
✅ SolarWinds ensured smooth monitoring of nodes and primary links, supporting proactive fault detection.

---

## 4. 📌 Wireshark

**How I used it:**  
I used Wireshark as a packet analyzer for deep troubleshooting when facing complex issues such as packet drops, VoIP call quality problems, or unusual traffic.

**Practical Example:**  
By capturing and analyzing packets, I could identify malformed packets, jitter, retransmissions, or specific applications consuming bandwidth. This helped isolate issues faster than using device logs alone.

**Summary:**  
✅ Wireshark helped me dive deep into network traffic to troubleshoot packet-level problems.

---

## 5. 📌 Microsoft Visio

**How I used it:**  
I used Visio to design logical and physical network diagrams. These diagrams documented the infrastructure, showing device interconnections, IP addressing schemes, and failover designs.

**Practical Example:**  
When proposing new setups or troubleshooting complex environments, I presented Visio diagrams to management and team members. These visuals simplified communication and made the network easier to understand.

**Summary:**  
✅ Visio helped me document and design network layouts for better planning and communication.

---

## 📖 Final Note

These tools formed the foundation of my daily workflow in network operations. Together, they enabled me to:  
- Perform **device configuration & health checks** 🖥️  
- Monitor **nodes, links, and utilization** 📊  
- Troubleshoot **packet-level issues** 📡  
- Document **network architecture** 🗂️

# Active Directory Lab with DHCP, NAT, and Client Setup

This project demonstrates the setup of an **Active Directory Domain Controller (DC)** with DHCP, NAT, and client integration using **Server 2019** and **Windows 10** inside **VirtualBox** or **VMware**. The lab simulates a small enterprise network with Internet connectivity and centralized management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

  - NIC 2 (Internal): Static IP `172.16.0.1`  
  - Roles: AD DS, DNS, DHCP, NAT
- **Client1 (Windows 10)**  
  - NIC (Internal): Gets IP from DC via DHCP  
  - Domain-joined to `mydomain.com`

---

## 🌐 Network Configuration

### Domain Controller (Server 2019)
- **Internal NIC**  
  - IP: `172.16.0.1`  
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
  - DNS: `127.0.0.1`

  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
  - Gateway: `172.168.0.1`  
  - DNS: `172.16.0.1`  

### Client1 (Windows 10)
- NIC (Internal): Receives DHCP from DC  
- Domain: `mydomain.com`  

---

## ⚡ Features
- Centralized **Active Directory domain** for authentication.  
- **DHCP** for automatic IP assignment.  
- **DNS** for domain resolution.  
- **NAT/RAS** to allow internal clients access to the Internet.  
- **PowerShell scripting** to bulk-create users (+1,000 test accounts).  

---

## 🔧 Requirements
- Virtualization software (VirtualBox or VMware).  
- **Windows Server 2019 ISO**.  
- **Windows 10 ISO**.  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install **Server 2019** VM with 2 NICs (Internet + Internal).  
2. Configure static IP on internal NIC (`172.16.0.1`).  
3. Install and configure AD DS, DNS, DHCP, and NAT.  
4. Create domain `mydomain.com`.  
5. Install **Windows 10** VM, connect it to the Internal network, and join it to the domain.  
6. Use provided **PowerShell script** to create test users.  

---

## 📜 Notes
- Ensure **Internal network** is only for domain communication.  
- NAT is required for client Internet access.  
- Adjust DHCP scope and DNS as per lab environment.

## Bulk Create 1000 Active Directory Users
Author: Precious Muyambo
Date: 2025-09-22

Import-Module ActiveDirectory

Organizational Unit (OU) where users will be created
$OU = "OU=LabUsers,DC=mydomain,DC=com"

Loop through 1 to 1000
for ($i = 1; $i -le 1000; $i++) {
    $Username = "User$i"
    $Password = "P@ssw0rd123!" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force

    New-ADUser `
        -Name $Username `
        -SamAccountName $Username `
        -UserPrincipalName "$Username@mydomain.com" `
        -Path $OU `
        -AccountPassword $Password `
        -Enabled $true `
        -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false

    Write-Output "Created user: $Username"
}


---

## 🔧 How It Works:

The script uses the Active Directory module (Import-Module ActiveDirectory).

It loops from User1 to User1000.

Each account is created with:

SamAccountName = User1, User2, … User1000

Default password = P@ssw0rd123!

Domain = mydomain.com

OU = OU=LabUsers,DC=mydomain,DC=com (replace with your actual OU path).

Accounts are enabled immediately.
